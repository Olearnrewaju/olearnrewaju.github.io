# Hi, I'm Olanrewaju Awoyele 👋

I'm a **Credit Risk Analyst** at First Bank of Nigeria with a background in real estate valuation and financial analysis. I'm passionate about using data to drive better business decisions in banking and finance.

## What I Do

At First Bank, I work with:
- Credit risk assessment and mitigation
- Collateral analysis and valuation review
- Loan portfolio monitoring using Finacle and Fintrak
- Regulatory compliance and risk management
- Stakeholder management across departments

## My Data Analytics Journey

In 2026, I embarked on a focused journey to master data analytics tools and techniques. While I work with data daily in my banking role, I wanted to build deeper technical skills to create custom solutions, automate reporting, and provide more sophisticated insights.

**What I'm Building:**
- **SQL** - Advanced querying and database management
- **Power BI** - Interactive dashboards and risk visualization
- **Python** - Data analysis, automation, and pipeline development
- **Business Intelligence** - End-to-end analytics solutions

**Why This Matters:**

Every day at First Bank, I see opportunities where data analytics could:
- Automate manual reporting processes (saving hours per week)
- Provide real-time portfolio monitoring
- Identify risk patterns earlier
- Present insights more effectively to stakeholders

This portfolio documents my learning journey and showcases practical projects that solve real banking and finance problems.
